# What is GitcoinDAO
-   Gitcoin is a [**Decentralized Autonomous Organization**](https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/about) governed by the holders of the GTC token.
-   Token holders [**delegate their votes**](https://gitcoin.co/quadraticlands/about) to a [**trusted steward**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41/7). Some choose to self delegate.
-   The stewards then accept or decline actions by **[voting for proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth)** which pass quorum.
-   Official proposals and formal conversations on governance can be found on the [**Governance Forum**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/)
-   Informal conversation about workstreams, and idea sharing happens in [**Discord](http://discord.gg/gitcoin)**
-   Checkout the [**documentation**](https://github.com/gitcoinco/governance-docs) about the GTC/GitcoinDAO smart contracts.

# Why GitcoinDAO
In 2018, I knew [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) and I was inspired by its [Mission](https://gitcoin.co/mission) - Build and fund the digital public goods. At that time one of the core values is **Give First**. This is the fundamental of public goods (as well community).

So I started to involve in Gitcoin like bounty, tips, kudos etc, in the meantime, I translated some of great posts into Chinese. 

For now there are many opportunities in GitcoinDAO, we need you to build the GitcoinDAO together ;) Find more info in next section.
