# Gitcoin

## Concept

Before introducing Gitcoin, I'd like to make a recommendation of [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/).

Gitcoin is a platform for funding public goods. From the bounties platform at the beginning, to the grants and study now, it has always been around public goods. It has the following product functions:

- [Bounties](https://gitcoin.co/explorer)
- [Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)
- [Hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons)
- [Quests](https://gitcoin.co/quests)
- [Kudos](https://gitcoin.co/kudos)
- [Incubator-Kernel](https://kernel.community/)

We can experience the function of the product by ourselves. Here's how to join `GitcoinDAO` to contribute.
