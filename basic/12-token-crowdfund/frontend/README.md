## Crowdfunding Contract Front-End
This sample demonstrates the basic process of a crowdfunding contract, including the deployment of the contract, the contract, and the launch of a crowdfunding project.

## Operation Process
- Configure The Private Key
Put the private key in the **.env** file and its format is as follows
```
VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  //the private key
VITE_INFURA_ID=yyyyyyyy  //infura id
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=zzzzzzzzzzzzz  //contract address
```
Then the code automatically reads private key from **.env** file.

- Install Dependencies
```
yarn
```

- Start Project
```
yarn dev
```

- Compile Project
```
yarn build
```
