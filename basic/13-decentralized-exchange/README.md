### EtherDelta

[See EtherDelta parsing and Testing for details :point_right:](./EtherDelta/README.md)

### uniswap-v1-like

Fork **uniV1** project. The original project was to develop the contract with Vyper. Here we will write a **uniswapV1** using **solidity 0.8.0** to get a deeper understanding of **uniswap**.

[See uniswap-v1-like for details :point_right:](./uniswap-v1-like/README.md)
