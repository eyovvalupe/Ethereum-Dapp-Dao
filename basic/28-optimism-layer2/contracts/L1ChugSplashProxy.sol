/**
 * @title L1ChugSplashProxy
 * @dev Basic ChugSplash proxy contract for L1. Very close to being a normal proxy but has added
 * functions `setCode` and `setStorage` for changing the code or storage of the contract. Nifty!
 *
 * Note for future developers: do NOT make anything in this contract 'public' unless you know what
 * you're doing. Anything public can potentially have a function signature that conflicts with a
 * signature attached to the implementation contract. Public functions SHOULD always have the
 * 'proxyCallIfNotOwner' modifier unless there's some *really* good reason not to have that
 * modifier. And there almost certainly is not a good reason to not have that modifier. Beware!
