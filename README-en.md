</div>

## Preface

This project is suitable for developers with a certain language foundation to develop blockchain DAPP, understand and develop **DeFi, NFT, DAO, CRYPTO** projects from shallow to deep.

The project vision is to give **junior developers** an executable and simplest blockchain **DAPP** learning roadmap, and **advanced developers** a platform for communication and cooperation.

The project is deeply combined with [rebase university](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DS0hYTUJiUVlqVXVQ), and a learning group is established to divide tasks, and then work together to study the mainstream DAPP project, share technology every week, and the output results will be uploaded to the [rebase account](https://space.bilibili.com/382886213) of station Bilibili as a video.

The project adheres to the concept of [open source university](https://github.com/rebase-network/Rebase-University) and will manage the open source project in the form of Dao governance. The project can read the Rebase official account [welcome to Dapp-Learning](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/79eRMtB_yz8G6H8_saCeLw). This project is sponsored by [Ethereum foundation](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/), and we will reward the outstanding contributors of the project. Welcome to our Twitter [DAPP learning twitter](https://twitter.com/Dapp_Learning). 

This project is still under development. It is suitable for developers at all stages to join. Welcome to pull requests to create more tutorial projects or improve existing tutorial projects
ðŸ¤—.Join our developer communication group by submitting PR or sharing at [rebase university](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DS0hYTUJiUVlqVXVQ), Provide triple quality pull requests - you can be a pull request reviewer, and participate in making decisions about project direction. **Project management rules**, see [how new members participate and project governance rules](./docs/dao.md), welcome to join us if you have the same idea.



Technology Stackï¼š
- `web3.js`
- `ethers.js (Hardhat)`
- `web3.py (Brownie)`
- `Java` (Optional)
- `Rust` (Optional)
- `Go` (Optional)

## Project structure
The project is divided into two parts: **Basic task** and **Project task**
- **Basic task**
Basic tool components necessary to familiarize and integrate blockchain development (e.g. ERC standard, Oracle, GRAPH, IPFS)
- **Project task**
Study the classic projects of mainstream DeFi, NFT, Dao and crypto, so that developers can go deep into the actual project development. We will set up a study group to divide tasks and discuss and study project source code together.

## Preparatory Work
**Basic knowledge preparation**
- It is advisable for novice developers to learn the basics of Ethereum and Solidity before embarking on formal Dapp development.
You can refer to [basic knowledge preparation](./docs/basic-knowledge.md) for novice partners to learn and reference.

**Development tool**
- Sharp tools make good work. Familiarize yourself with basic development tools.
Refer to [recommended development tools](./docs/develop-tools.md) to view the current mainstream blockchain development tools.

**Recommended reading**
We have compiled a list of classic blockchain-related books to help developers gain an in-depth understanding of the current humanities behind blockchain.
- ã€ŠSovereign Individualsã€‹, Follow public account[Unknown Scripture](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/homepage?__biz=MzU4NDQwMTc3MQ==&hid=7&sn=124258360d0a530008a41ea32e7c2bf2&scene=1&devicetype=android-29&version=28000b3b&lang=en&nettype=WIFI&ascene=7&session_us=gh_353f7f41a447&wx_header=1).
- The Austrian school of thought is recommended,[Hayek Life introduction](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/p1UZdt5BAQVJ3kl_CniwKQ).
- Series articles [Austrian economics school of thought for blockchain enthusiasts](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/appmsgalbum?__biz=MzU0ODk1MTE1MA==&action=getalbum&album_id=1986143111768489985&scene=173&from_msgid=2247484102&from_itemidx=1&count=3&nolastread=1#wechat_redirect)
- [ã€ŠPolitical Economyã€‹](https://www.marxists.org/subject/economy/index.htm)

At the same time, welcome to add recommended books, please add in this document [Book recommendation](./docs/books.md).

**Encryption course**

We will compile some crypto courses from top universities abroad and the Ethereum community to help developers systematically understand blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
- [MIT Online Course: Blockchain and Money by Prof. Gary Gensler](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/)
- [Berkeley Online Course:](https://berkeley-defi.github.io/f21)   [Defi Learning](https://defi-learning.org/)
- [Standford Online Course: CS 251 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies](https://cs251.stanford.edu/syllabus.html)

If you have other high-quality course recommendations, we also hope you can add courses to this document by request[Recommendations for cryptographic courses](./docs/crypto-course.md).



## Basic Tasks

Understand the basic tools and development knowledge of developing DAPP through the following basic tasks.
For DAPP architecture, please refer to the article--[the difference between Web2.0 and Web3.0 applications from the architectural dimension](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/414635679?utm_source=wechat_session&utm_medium=social&utm_oi=778564687968092160&s_r=0).
Learn and run the first 20 tasks locally and upgrade to focus on **project tasks** 
You are welcome to PR improvements to existing tutorial projects or to create more tutorial projects

Welcome to submit pull request,[Add a new basic task or update the above task](https://github.com/rebase-network/Dapp-Learning/issues/new)

## Advanced task

**The preparatory work**:
  For developers with a certain foundation, this part selects mainstream high-quality projects for source code analysis and code review
  The project can be deployed to the test network collaboratively and shared with the Rebase community as a basis. Large DEFI projects are novel and large in content, so we suggest a division of labor and cooperation, such as one person to read the white paper, one person to be responsible for the front end, one person to be responsible for the contract, and one person to be responsible for data presentation.
  Developers can initiate project research initiatives, form groups, and collaborate within development groups. This section is recommended as a submodule introduction.

## DeFi advanced task
 It is recommended to read DEFI classics first
